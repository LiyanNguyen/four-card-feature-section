### My Process
Create the layout on Desktop Viewport first, as it is more complicated.
![method-1](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/50958126/161497810-d30514f5-7142-4065-8b68-4599fa5e7c59.png)

Then create the layout for Mobile Viewport, making sure both viewports have the correct layout.
![method-2](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/50958126/161497964-cad5d218-df18-497e-8c24-3447dcd60824.png)

After that, put in the contents of each section one by one and remove the background colors acting as a layout guide.

### Built with
- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I Learned
- Always create a mock-up layout first, before any other content, this makes sure we avoid problems in later stages of designing
- Desktop approach first or Mobile design approach first doesn't really matter, you will still have to create 2 different styles
